        <h1>I'm Sean Dickey. I was born with a wild imagination AND an affinity
            for analysis and organization that borders on obsession. The world
            of web design and development balances these two aspects of my personality
            and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.</h1>

      <div id="love" class="grid_5">
        <h2>Love</h2>
        <p>I love my amazing wife. And I love beer. Luckily, I just happened to
           have this photo of my wife drinking beer. Bonus.</p>

        <h2>Then &amp; Now</h2>
        <p>I started out as a wee lad in England. I lived in several states as
           my father was reassigned to different Air Force bases around the country.
           Eventually, my family settled in Colorado, where I lived for 25 years. I'm currently
           living in San Jose, CA with my wife, our two mutts&mdash;Etta James &amp; Coletrane&mdash;
           and one very big-boned tabby cat named Frances.
        </p>

        <p>I'm a proud memeber of the Dev Bootcamp Red Admirals cohort, where I'm honing my skills
           to become a world-class beginner in web development and design.
        </p>

        <h2>Quirks</h2>
        <p>I like a lot of things from eras long past. My taste in clothes, music,
           design, and automobiles are influenced by the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. Some folks think that's
           pretty quirky.
